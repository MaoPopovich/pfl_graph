# pfl_graph
+ This repository presents a unified framework for personalized federated learning on graph-structured data, mainly for node-level tasks.
+ Part of these codes are motivated by [PFL-Non-IID](https://github.com/TsingZ0/PFL-Non-IID.git)
+ To run our ConFGL implementation, please select "grace" model and "Ditto" FL algorithm in  `run.sh` script.
